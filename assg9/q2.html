CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a cornerstone of modern web design, serving as the 
essential bridge between raw content and a polished user experience. By separating 
structure from presentation, CSS allows designers to control every visual detail—from 
precise typography and spacing to complex layouts and responsive behavior across 
devices. Without CSS, websites would be reduced to plain, unstyled text, lacking the 
visual hierarchy and aesthetic appeal necessary to engage users and communicate 
information effectively in today's digital landscape.
