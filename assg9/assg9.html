CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a cornerstone of modern web design, serving as the essential bridge between raw content and a polished user experience. By separating structure from presentation, CSS allows designers to control every visual detail—from precise typography and spacing to complex layouts and responsive behavior across devices. Without CSS, websites would be reduced to plain, unstyled text, lacking the visual hierarchy and aesthetic appeal necessaryto engage users and communicate information effectively in today's digital landscape.
